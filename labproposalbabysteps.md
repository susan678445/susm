# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

BabySteps Habit Tracker

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A habit tracker that lets you check off daily required tasks such as exercising or meditating etc

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The habit tracker will be a very simple Python program, written and executed on Visual Studio Code. It should let the user input a list of habits at the beginning, and then mark them as "done" for the day, all by typing responses through the terminal. The updated list will appear in the program, with an indication of what has been done and what hasn't. It won't save any data or have extra features, just a simple one-time tracker for daily habits in the same session.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

none
## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

none

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

-Allows users to enter a list of daily habits.
-Lets users mark each habit as "done"
-Displays the status of completed and incomplete tasks

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

-Allows users to monitor their daily habits.
-Automatically resets completion status for a new day, but the habit list is still stored.
-Stores all the tracking data in a file and allows users to review their progress history.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

I hope I can update it to save information instead of it being a one-time thing

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I'm going to work on improving my filehandling skills and also educate myself on data structures more.
